Hello! I'm a PhD candidate at [UVA's School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu) and an Air Force officer. I'm currently in the final year of my PhD program, working under the supervision of [Prof. Donald E. Brown](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/donald-e-brown-phd). My research primarily focuses on two areas: optimization and Bayesian statistical estimation. Specifically, I am interested in how these can be used to compute and assess the clinical implications of entropy in biomedical signals.

In my spare time, you'll likely find me on the pickleball court -- an incredibly silly name for a surprisingly fun game. When I'm not doing that, I might be whipping up a spicy salsa in the kitchen or enjoying the Air Force Academy's *uniquely* exciting brand of triple-option football.
